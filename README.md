# About the Project
Weight Tracker is a weight watching mobile application for Android
devices. The user can log daily weights in a list format and the app
will notify the user when they have reached a target weight. Having a
useful list of past records will help users reach their weight goals.

# Motivation
I am always eager to improve my health physically and mentally. When I
was required to develop an Android app for school, I saw a way to help
others in achieving good health. If this app helps just one person
to be more motivated or healthy, I will consider the project
a success.
